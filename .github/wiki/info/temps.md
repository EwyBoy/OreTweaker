# Ore-Tweaker Template Files

#### Path: `../config/oretweaker/templates`

## About:
The first time you launch Ore-Tweaker it will generate a few templates in the `../config/oretweaker/templates` folder. These templates contain preconfigured settings that can be copy-pasted and combined into creating the perfect Ore-Tweaking experience for you. You can replace the `oretweaker.json` with any of these files but remember to **rename** it to `oretweaker.json` cause that is the only file the mod will read the world generation from.

The templates are simply templates to act as a guide and show examples of how the mod can be used to configure the world in different ways. They can also save you a lot of time if you are borrowing from several templates to create the ultimate ore tweaking file for your modpack.
Make sure to read the section about [how to validate your json file](https://github.com/EwyBoy/OreTweaker/wiki/Validating-JSON-File).
