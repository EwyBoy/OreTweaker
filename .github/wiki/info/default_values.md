# Ore-Tweaker Default Values

Default Values The following is some default settings for vanilla ore generation for each ore:

## Default Values

The following tables contains the default settings used by Ore-Tweaker to mimic vanilla ore generation from vanilla Minecraft.
The values for some ores are interpolated approximations of the math equations behind the vanilla ore generation. 
The values are not perfect, but the world gen produced by these values are as close to vanilla ore generation as possible.

Blocks marked with a `*` at the end like: `minecraft:lapis_ore`* are using interpolated approximations.
This is due to the blocks using custom placement configs and distribution settings that are hard to replicate 100%.

Don't ask me why minecraft chose to add inn two different ways of spawning in nether quartz, nether gold and ancient debris, but they did.
That's why there are multiple entries with almost the same values. They are **not** duplicates.


## Default Files

### Path: `../config/oretweaker/data/`

This is where the default files are generated by the mod on launch if there is not already any files there under the same name. The files can be named pretty much anything, but must end with a `.json` extension. For the mod to find and read the file on launch, the file must be placed inside the `../config/oretweaker/data` folder.  

The mod will also generate backups of these file inside the [template folder](https://github.com/EwyBoy/OreTweaker/wiki/Templates), so if you mess up you can look at these files to find your way back to the default values for each ore.

The example below shows the `diamond_ore.json` file.
```json
{
  "oreConfig": [
    {
      "ore": "minecraft:diamond_ore",
      "filler": "minecraft:stone",
      "minY": 1,
      "maxY": 16,
      "maxVeinSize": 7,
      "spawnRate": 1.0,
      "biomeBlacklist": [],
      "biomeWhitelist": []
    }
  ]
}
```
