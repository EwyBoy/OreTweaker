# Debugging Ore-Tweaker

## Figuring out the problem

There can be several reasons why Ore Tweaker does not work for you. This page will help you narrow it down, so you can
get the problem fixed as fast as possible.

### Cases:

1. You configured the mod but none of the custom world-gen you configured seems to work. Everything looks like default
   Minecraft world gen.

2. You configured the mod but some or one of the entries don't work. Example can't get clay to spawn as an ore.

3. The mod crashes during start-up or while generating a world.

### Solutions:

1. You most likely have a syntax error in you're `oretweaker.json` file. Check out how you can fix this by clicking
