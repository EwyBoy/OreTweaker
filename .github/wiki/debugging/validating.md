# How to make sure you're OreTweaker.json file is valid 

If you are experiencing issues with Ore-Tweaker and none of the ore generation you just configured seems to work make sure your json file is valid and configured properly.
Small typos and markdown mistakes can occur, and these can be hard to spot. Below you will find a quick guide on how to spot these mistakes.

## How to make sure json file is valid:
* Copy-Paste the json file in a [json validator](https://jsonlint.com/) such as this one: https://jsonlint.com/ and have it validate your json. It will tell you what's wrong in red text, if there are any issues.
* Read the json file line by line slowly. Make sure the syntax is at the right place [ ] { } , `` etc or have someone else look at it, it's sometimes hard to spot errors like this after staring at the same file for a long time.
* Use a proper text editor tool such as [VS-Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or any of [these online tools](https://geekflare.com/json-online-tools/).
* Look at the [template](https://github.com/EwyBoy/OreTweaker/wiki/Templates) files generated by Ore-Tweaker in the `config/oretweaker/templates` folder.
