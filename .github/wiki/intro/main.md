## Ore Tweaker
Ore Tweaker is a tool that lets you control a lot of aspects when it comes to ore generation in Minecraft.

#### Features:
1. [Disable](https://github.com/EwyBoy/OreTweaker/wiki/Disabling-Ore-Generation) ores from Minecraft and various other mods.
2. [Tweak](https://github.com/EwyBoy/OreTweaker/wiki/Tweaking-Ore-Generation) ores from Minecraft and various other mods.
3. [Make](https://github.com/EwyBoy/OreTweaker/wiki/Custom-Ore-Generation) any block generate as an ore.

If you run into any problems while using Ore Tweaker or need help, check out the [debugging page](https://github.com/EwyBoy/OreTweaker/wiki/Debugging) first, and if you can't resolve your problem ask me personally here in my [Discord](http://discord.gg/eAsSV8dXX2).

#### Tips:
For the best debug experience while using Ore Tweaker I recommend using the mod [World-Stripper](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/world-stripper).
World Stripper is a utility mod that allows you to strip away the terrain to view the underground world generation. The mod is small and lightweight and made with performance in mind. The mod clears away terrain fast even on slow computers. Super useful if you're a pack developer and need to test world gen for your pack, or you just can't seem to find the ores you're looking for. Pretty much a must have tool for all map-makers, pack-makers and developers.
